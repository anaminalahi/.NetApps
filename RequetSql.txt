The timer will every minute read the time and test with the backup start time
the request queries the personal and filteredpictures tables
( rqList = (from p in DBCnx.PERSONNEL
                              join f in DBCnx.FILTEREDPICTURES
                                  on p.EMPID equals f.EMPID
                              where f.LNL_BLOB != null (we ignore the lines if it’s null)
                              orderby p.EMPID
                              select new
                              {
                                  p.EMPID,
                                  p.FULLNAME,
                                  DeactivationDate = f.LASTCHANGED,
                                  BlobData = f.LNL_BLOB,
                                  f.FORMAT_IMAGE
                              }). ToList();  )
the result is rqlist. Count
If it is greater than zero, we scan the data to build the csv 
we test if the image the format of the image is unknown, we ignore the recording
otherwise we create a corresponding line in the csv flow
We save the CSV file.
